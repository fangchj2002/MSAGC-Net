# Title 'Multi-scale KNN-based graph convolutional aggregation network with text prompt for jaw cyst segmentation

Integrating text prompt and graph attention convolutional network into multi-scale aggregation network for jaw cyst segmentation

The corrsponding dataset can be downloaded from the website: https://pan.baidu.com/s/13KMnDlZWgeyzq0XVI10j6Q and password: ztzu.

The pretrained model will be released at the the Baidu disk.

We use the nnUNetv2 framework, you can download for the website: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet.

The above files except for nnUNetTrainer.py are put into the fold:nnunetv2\training\nnUNetTrainer\variants\network_architecture.

In the meanwhile, you replace the nnUNetTrainer class file with uploaded file named as 'nnUNetTrainer.py.
